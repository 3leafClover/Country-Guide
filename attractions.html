  <p class="information" id="t3">The Burj Khalifa is a mixed-use skyscraper located in Dubai, U.A.E. It is the world's tallest building, according to all three of the main criteria by which such buildings are judged. The Burj Khalifa was officially named to honour the president of the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khalīfah ibn Zāyid Āl Nahyān.</p>
  <p class="information" style="width:300px ;left: 60px;">Not only is Burj Khalifa the world's tallest building but it has also broken two other impressive records: tallest structure, previously held by the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, and tallest free-standing structure, previously held by Toronto's CN Tower.</p>
